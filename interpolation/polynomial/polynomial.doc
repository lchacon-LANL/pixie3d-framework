C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        Subroutine DPLINT is designed to produce the polynomial which
C     interpolates the data  (X(I),Y(I)), I=1,...,N.  DPLINT sets up
C     information in the array C which can be used by subroutine DPOLVL
C     to evaluate the polynomial and its derivatives and by subroutine
C     DPOLCF to produce the coefficients.
C
C     Formal Parameters
C     *** All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION ***
C     N  - the number of data points  (N .GE. 1)
C     X  - the array of abscissas (all of which must be distinct)
C     Y  - the array of ordinates
C     C  - an array of information used by subroutines
C     *******  Dimensioning Information  *******
C     Arrays X,Y, and C must be dimensioned at least N in the calling
C     program.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        Subroutine DPOLCF computes the coefficients of the polynomial
C     fit (including Hermite polynomial fits ) produced by a previous
C     call to DPLINT.  The coefficients of the polynomial, expanded
C     about XX, are stored in the array D. The expansion is of the form
C     P(Z) = D(1) + D(2)*(Z-XX) +D(3)*((Z-XX)**2) + ... +
C                                                  D(N)*((Z-XX)**(N-1)).
C     Between the call to DPLINT and the call to DPOLCF the variable N
C     and the arrays X and C must not be altered.
C
C     *****  INPUT PARAMETERS
C      *** All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION ***
C
C     XX   - The point about which the Taylor expansion is to be made.
C
C     N    - ****
C            *     N, X, and C must remain unchanged between the
C     X    - *     call to DPLINT and the call to DPOLCF.
C     C    - ****
C
C     *****  OUTPUT PARAMETER
C      *** All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION ***
C
C     D    - The array of coefficients for the Taylor expansion as
C            explained in the abstract
C
C     *****  STORAGE PARAMETER
C
C     WORK - This is an array to provide internal working storage. It
C            must be dimensioned by at least 2*N in the calling program.
C
C
C     **** Note - There are two methods for evaluating the fit produced
C     by DPLINT. You may call DPOLVL to perform the task, or you may
C     call DPOLCF to obtain the coefficients of the Taylor expansion and
C     then write your own evaluation scheme. Due to the inherent errors
C     in the computations of the Taylor expansion from the Newton
C     coefficients produced by DPLINT, much more accuracy may be
C     expected by calling DPOLVL as opposed to writing your own scheme.
